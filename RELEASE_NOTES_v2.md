# Release v2.0: Futuristic AI Redesign 🚀

**"The System is Online."**

This release marks a complete visual and structural overhaul of the portfolio, transitioning from a traditional Bootstrap template to a custom-built **Futuristic / AI-Inspired Interface**.

## ✨ What's New
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: A sleek Dark Mode foundation with neon cyan/purple accents, glassmorphism effects, and "System" typography (`Space Grotesk` + `JetBrains Mono`).
- **Theme Toggle 🌗**: A completely new Light/Dark mode switcher. Toggle between the default "System Dark" and the clean "Lab Light" mode.
- **Mobile-First Layout 📱**: Replaced the legacy sidebar with a responsive **HUD Navigation** bar, ensuring a native app-like experience on iPhone, iPad, and Desktop.
- **Content Restoration**: All professional experience logs, simple skills matrix, and case study details have been meticulously restored and formatted for the new theme.
- **Improved Navigation**: Replaced buggy modal popups with fast, dedicated page routes for Case Studies, improving SEO and linkability.

## 🛠️ Tech Improvements
- **Zero Framework Dependency**: Removed heavy Bootstrap CSS dependency in favor of lightweight, custom CSS variables.
- **Relative Path Fix**: Corrected all asset linkages to ensure images load correctly on GitHub Pages sub-directories.
- **Legacy Archive**: Includes `original_portfolio_v1.zip`, a snapshot of the pre-redesign codebase.
